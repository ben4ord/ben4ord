## Benjamin Ford

* I am a Senior at Western Colorado University perusing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a emphasis in Machin Learning I am also
getting a minor in math. 

## What got me started

* While in middle school I played a lot of moded Minecraft. I really wanted to make my own Minecraft mods but I soon found that I was out of my league. 
This attempt at coding sparked my interest in computer science. Throughout Highschool I made simple games and algorithms which lead me to peruse a degree in Computer Science.

## Future Goals
* My future goals are to graduate with my bachelors and find a job in Data Development, Data Analysis, or Software Development. In the future I would like to work for a software company focused around the enviorment and enviormental conservation. Outside of academics my goal is to travel around the world and catch every kind of fish.
