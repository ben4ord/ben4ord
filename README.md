## Benjamin Ford

* I am a Senior at Western Colorado University perusing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a emphasis in Machine Learning and a Minor in Math. 

## What got me started

* While in middle school I played a lot of moded Minecraft. I really wanted to make my own Minecraft mods but I soon found that I was out of my league. 
This attempt at coding sparked my interest in computer science. Throughout Highschool I made simple games and algorithms which lead me to peruse a degree in Computer Science.

## Future Goals
* My future goals are to graduate with my bachelors and find a job in Machine Learning, Data Development, Data Analysis, or Software Development. My Ideal company is one focused on helping people either through medical software, machine learning algortithms to detect diseases or a company focused on enviormental conservation. Outside of academics my goal is to travel around the world and catch every kind of fish.
